# ðŸ§  Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience â€“ Forage
A data analytics project completed as part of the **Quantium Job Simulation** on Forage. This simulation mimics real-world retail challenges and demonstrates how data-driven insights can support customer segmentation, product strategy and store performance evaluation.

This experience involved analyzing retail transaction and customer data to deliver insights in three core areas:
1. ðŸ§¾ Customer Behavior Analysis
2. ðŸ“ˆ Trial vs Control Store Performance Evaluation
3. ðŸ“Š Data Storytelling & Reporting

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The objective of this simulation was to analyze snacking chips customer data, evaluate a trial store layout intervention and provide actionable insights for Quantiumâ€™s retail client.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Breakdown

### Task 1: ðŸ§¾ Customer & Sales Analysis

**Objective:** Understand customer purchasing behavior and identify key segments.

**Steps:**
- Analyzed transaction and customer datasets
- Cleaned and joined transaction and customer datasets
- Analyzed chip units sold and sales by identified customer segments 
- Created visualizations to explore behavioral trends

**Results:**
- Identified **Mainstream Young Singles & Couples** as primary category shoppers
- Found growth potential among **Young and Older Families**
- Observed consistent affluence across life stages but higher engagement from family groups

**Files:**
- Dataset Files: `QVI_purchase_behaviour`, `QVI_transaction_data`
- Code File: `Data Exploration and Analysis - Task 1.Rmd`
- Code with Output/Results File: `Data Exploration and Analysis - Task 1.pdf`
  
### Task 2: ðŸ§ª Trial vs Control Store Analysis

**Objective:** Find control stores based on the prior performance of the trial stores

**Steps:**
- Defined performance metrics (e.g., total sales, number of customers)
- Selected Control Stores based on trend similarity (not averages)
- Conducted comparative time series analysis
- Used ggplot2 to visualize trends pre and post-trial

**Results:**
- Identified control stores for the trial stores
- Delivered recommendations based on sales lift and engagement patterns

**Files:**
- Dataset File **(Created after running code in Task 1)**: `QVI_data.zip` - Unzip file to view dataset
- Code File: `Retail Strategy and Analytics - Task 2.Rmd`
- Code with Output/Results File: `Retail Strategy and Analytics - Task 2.pdf`
  
### Task 3: ðŸ“Š Insights & Reporting

**Objective:** Structure insights using the **Pyramid Principle** and present to stakeholders.

**Steps:**
- Synthesized findings into a business-focused narrative
- Created polished data visualizations and slide summaries
- Compiled a report with recommendations and key takeaways

**Results:**
- Final report (R Markdown to PDF)
- Slide-ready visuals
- Strategic insights for scaling the layout intervention across stores

**Files:**
- PowerPoint Presentation: `Presentation_BRAND - Task 3.pptx`
- File for client: `Presentation_BRAND - Task 3.pdf`
  
  ## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used:

- **R** (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `ggmosaic`, `lubridate`, `scale`, )
- **RMarkdown** for reproducible reporting
- **PowerPoint** for stakeholder communication
- **PDF** for creating final files and reports

ðŸ“ˆ **Business Impact:**
- Data supports scaling the layout redesign to stores with similar profiles  
- Customer segmentation enables more targeted promotions  
- Insights help optimize store experience and chip category performance
